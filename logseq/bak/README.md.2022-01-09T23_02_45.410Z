# Clojupedia

Prototype of a community-driven effort to centralize knowledge about Clojure libraries and resources.

Powerful query capabilities organized around a knowledge graph for discovering the libraries you need (and deserve).

See current version, a basic example exploring core features and capabilities, at [this link](https://clojupedia.github.io/#/page/contents).
